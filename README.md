# Voter Model on Heavy-Tailed Directed Networks

This repository contains Python simulations of **opinion dynamics and consensus formation** on **directed networks** with **heavy-tailed degree distributions**.  
The project explores how network topology (in particular, heavy-tailed in- and out-degree distributions) affects consensus time and opinion evolution.

The code is intended for **academic / educational use**, especially for students or researchers interested in:
- Complex networks
- Voter models and consensus dynamics
- Directed configuration models
- Heavy-tailed (Pareto-like) degree distributions

## Project Structure

The repository currently includes the following scripts:

- **`Directed Distribution Consensus.py`**  
 Analyzes consensus times for the voter model on directed networks generated by the directed configuration model with heavy-tailed degree distributions. The script compares empirical consensus times obtained from simulations with a theoretical limiting distribution using ECDFs and density plots.

- **`Directed Wright-Fisher diffusion.py`**  
  Studies the diffusion approximation of opinion dynamics on directed networks. The script investigates the evolution of opinion density and its relationship with theoretical predictions derived from Wright–Fisher–type diffusion limits in the presence of degree heterogeneity.

- **`Directed Discordant edges.py`**  
  Simulates the time evolution of discordant edges in the directed voter model. Multiple realizations of the dynamics are run on a fixed directed network, and empirical trajectories are compared with the theoretical prediction linking opinion density and the fraction of discordant edges.

## Model Overview

The simulations are based on variants of the **voter model**, where:
- Each node represents an agent with a binary opinion.
- The network is **directed**, meaning influence is asymmetric.
- Degrees are drawn from **heavy-tailed (Pareto) distributions**, allowing for hubs and strong heterogeneity.
- Opinion updates follow stochastic rules based on neighbors’ states.

Some scripts explore:
- Eulerian vs non-Eulerian directed graphs
- Regular vs heterogeneous out-degree configurations
- Fixed (quenched) vs annealed network structures
